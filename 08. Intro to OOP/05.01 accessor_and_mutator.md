An accessor is a class method used to read data members,
while a mutator is a class method used to change data members.
Also known as getters and setters and probably a dozen other terms.

Here's an example:

```cpp
class MyBar;

class Foo
{
    public:
        MyBar GetMyBar() const { return mMyBar; } // accessor
        void SetMyBar(MyBar aMyBar) { mMyBar = aMyBar; } // mutator

    private:
        MyBar mMyBar;
}
```

It's best practice to make data members private (as in the example above) 
and only access them via accessors and mutators. This is for the following reasons:

You know when they are accessed (and can debug this via a breakpoint).
The mutator can validate the input to ensure it fits within certain constraints.
If you need to change the internal implementation, you can do so without breaking 
a lot of external code -- instead you just modify the way the accessors/mutators 
reference the internal data.
